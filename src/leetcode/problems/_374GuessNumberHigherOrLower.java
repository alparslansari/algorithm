/** 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 * Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
 *
 * You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns 3 possible results:
 *    -1: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
 *     1: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
 *     0: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. pick == num).
 * Return the number that I picked.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 10, pick = 6
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 1, pick = 1
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: n = 2, pick = 1
 * Output: 1
